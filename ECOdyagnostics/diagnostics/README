Plan of implementation:

- Create a central toolkit used to perform the calculations. It uses xgcm, numpy, xarray operations but extends
  them to allow the output of a variable e.g. on a specific gridpoint, or with specific discretizations like NEMO.

- Add sidemodules which perform the respective computations (e.g. power, flow, energy, ...)


    --- tools.py ---
    -> Define the settings for the operations when used (e.g nemo discretization, grid=static/variable)

    - Remapping
    - Output grid position ('standard': Redirect to standard xgcm operations; 'custom': Customized)
    -

    --- power.py ---

   -> Calcultaion for power input

   --- flow.py ---
   -> Calculations of flow, transport...
