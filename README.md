# ECOdiagnostics
A diagnostics Package for the Energy Cycle of the Ocean. 
It builds on the fundamental descriptions of energy in the ocean, 
applied to numerical ocean model simulation data. Various theoretical considerations of energy
are included to give a comprehensive tool for analysing the oceans energy cycle.
The core of this package is the approach used in ..., applied for NEMO ocean engine simulation data.
